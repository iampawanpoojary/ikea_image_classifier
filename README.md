# ikea_image_classifier

# The file "ikea_find_product.ipynb" in the master directory contains the code for the model.
# I have added a link to google colab , if you need to run the code yourself just click on "run in google colab" on top, in the ipynb file.
# Note: you will need to load your own dataset since the one I used is on my google drive.
# I have a forked dataset in https://github.com/iampawanpoojary/ikea which you could use.
